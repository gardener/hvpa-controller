# tools as needed.

# Tool targets should declare go.mod as a prerequisite, if the tool's version is managed via go modules. This causes
# make to rebuild the tool in the desired version, when go.mod is changed.
# For tools where the version is not managed via go.mod, we use a file per tool and version as an indicator for make
# whether we need to install the tool or a different version of the tool (make doesn't rerun the rule if the rule is
# changed).

# Use this "function" to add the version file as a prerequisite for the tool target: e.g.
#   $(HELM): $(call tool_version_file,$(HELM),$(HELM_VERSION))

# This target cleans up any previous version files for the given tool and creates the given version file.
# This way, we can generically determine, which version was installed without calling each and every binary explicitly.
